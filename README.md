## Database Migration from On-Prem SQL Server to Azure SQL using Azure Migrate  

This repository documents the step-by-step process of migrating an on-prem SQL Server database to **Azure SQL Database** using **Azure Migrate** and **Data Migration Assistant (DMA)**.  

### Assumption  
- An **Azure SQL Server** and **Azure SQL Database** are already provisioned.  

---

## ðŸš€ Migration Steps  

### Step 1: Search for Azure Migrate and Choose "Databases (Only)"  
1. Go to the **Azure Portal** and search for **Azure Migrate**.  
2. Select **Databases (only)** as the migration scope.  
3. Create a new **Azure Migrate project** and give it a meaningful name for future reference.

---

### Step 2: Download **Data Migration Assistant (DMA)**  
- If **DMA** is not installed, download and install it from [Microsoft's official page](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=53595).  

---

### Step 3: Perform Compatibility Assessment Using DMA  
1. Open **DMA** and select **Assessment**.  
2. Set **Source type** as `SQL Server` and **Target type** as `Azure SQL Database`.  
3. Choose your **on-prem database** (e.g., `AdventureWorks2017`).

---

### Step 4: Select Assessment Options  
- Retain both checkboxes:  
  âœ… **Check database compatibility**  
  âœ… **Check feature parity**  
- This will identify unsupported SQL Server features in **Azure SQL Database**.

---

### Step 5: Review Assessment Results  
- If there are no errors, the database is ready for migration.  
- If there are warnings/errors, resolve them before proceeding.

### Step 6: Connect DMA to Azure Subscription  
1. In DMA, sign in to your **Azure Subscription**.  
2. Once authenticated, a confirmation message will appear: **"Assessment Uploaded"**.

---

### Step 7: Verify Assessment in Azure Migrate  
- Return to **Azure Migrate** and check if the **Assessment data** is reflected.  
- This might take some time depending on **network bandwidth**.

### Step 8: Start Migration in DMA  
1. In **DMA**, select **Migration** instead of Assessment.  
2. Enter a **Project Name** and details.  
3. Choose **Schemas and Data** to migrate both structure and records.
