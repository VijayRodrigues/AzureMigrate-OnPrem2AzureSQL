# üöÄ On-Premises SQL Server to Azure SQL Migration using Azure Migrate

This repository provides a step-by-step guide to migrating an **on-premises SQL Server database** to **Azure SQL Database** using **Azure Migrate**.

---

## üìå Assumptions
- An **Azure SQL Server** and an **Azure SQL Database** are already provisioned.
- You have the necessary permissions to create an **Azure Migrate** project.
- You have access to the on-prem SQL Server that you want to migrate.

---

## üî• Migration Steps

### **Step 1: Search for Azure Migrate and Create a Project**
1. In the **Azure Portal**, search for **Azure Migrate**.
2. Select **Databases** as the migration goal.
3. Click **Create project** and provide a meaningful **Project Name**.  
   - This project will be referenced throughout the migration process.
   - Choose the appropriate **Resource Group** and **Subscription**.  


---

### Step 2: Install Data Migration Assistant (DMA)
- If **Data Migration Assistant (DMA)** is not already installed on your system, download it from [Microsoft's official site](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=53595) and install it.  
- This tool is required to analyze and migrate databases from your **on-premises SQL Server** to **Azure SQL Database**.

### **Step 3: Launch DMA and Start a New Assessment**
1. Open **DMA** and select **+ New** to create a new project.  
2. Choose **"Assessment"** as the migration type.  
3. Set a **Project Name** for reference.  
4. Select:

---

### **Step 4: Select Assessment Options**
- Choose **Check database compatibility** and **Check feature parity**.

---

### **Step 5: Review Assessment Results**
1. After the scan, **DMA** will show the results.  
2. Here, you can review:
   - Any compatibility issues.
   - Deprecated features from the on-premises SQL Server.
- If you‚Äôre migrating from an **older SQL Server version**, you may see additional warnings.

---

### **Step 6: Connect DMA to Azure Subscription**
1. **Connect your Azure account** in DMA.  
2. Sign in using your **Azure credentials** and select the appropriate **Azure workspace**.  
3. A confirmation message **"Assessment Uploaded"** will appear upon successful connection.

---

### **Step 7: Verify the Assessment in Azure Migrate**
- Navigate back to **Azure Migrate** in the Azure portal.  
- Open the **project you created in Step 1**.  
- Check if the **assessment results** are available. The time taken depends on your network speed.

---

### **Step 8: Start the Migration Process in DMA**
1. In **DMA**, select **Migration** instead of **Assessment**.  
2. Enter a **new project name** and configure other necessary details.  
3. Choose **the target Azure SQL Database**.  
4. Select **Schema and data** to include tables with all schemas

---

### **Step 9: Connect to the Source Database (On-Prem SQL Server)**
1. In the **Source Server** field, enter the **on-prem SQL Server instance name**.  
2. Provide the **authentication details** (Windows Authentication or SQL Server authentication).  
3. Select the source **SQL Server database** you want to migrate.

---

### **Step 11: Select Objects to Migrate**
- The DMA will scan the source database and list **all objects (tables, views, stored procedures, triggers, etc.)**.  
- Select the objects you wish to migrate. If you want to move everything, select **all tables**.

‚úÖ **Check for Errors & Logs** ‚Äì Look for any migration failures and review error logs if needed.  
‚úÖ **Test Performance** ‚Äì Run queries and ensure response times meet expectations.  
‚úÖ **Optimize Azure SQL** ‚Äì Check for missing indexes, optimize queries, and configure performance recommendations.  
‚úÖ **Monitor Database Performance** ‚Äì Set up **Azure SQL Monitoring**, **Query Performance Insights**, and **Auditing** for ongoing performance tracking.  
‚úÖ **Update Connection Strings** ‚Äì Update application configs and ETL workflows to point to **Azure SQL** instead of the old on-prem SQL Server.
